# Lip-Reading-MIRACL-VC1

## Overview
Traditional Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle in noisy environments and when dealing with overlapping speech. This limitation can be mitigated by using Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), which aims to predict or recognize spoken words by analyzing the movements of a speaker's lips and facial gestures, without relying on audio input.

## Motivation
The recent progress in deep learning has opened new avenues for tackling complex tasks like lip reading. Neural network-based approaches have shown promising results in various machine learning domains, including speech and image recognition. This advancement provides a solid foundation for developing effective VSR systems capable of operating in challenging scenarios.

## Problem Statement
To design and develop a neural network-based VSR system that can accurately recognize spoken language solely from visual input, overcoming challenges such as:
- Noisy environments
- Overlapping speech
- Variations in lighting conditions

## Goals
- Develop a deep learning model for accurate lip reading.
- Achieve robustness in different environmental conditions (noise, lighting).
- Test and validate the system on diverse datasets to ensure reliability.

## Technologies
- Deep Learning (using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Computer Vision for facial and lip feature extraction
- Neural networks for classification and prediction tasks
